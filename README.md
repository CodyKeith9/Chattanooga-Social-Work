# Chattanooga-Social-Work

Cody Keith 

A find all for Chattanooga Social work resources. (Quick-start school project) 

Technical use - HTML, CSS, bootstrap, Co-Pilot (Git pathing issues)

Future improvements - Finish. UI is still basic. I want to spend more time in CSS creating a fun and exciting way to navigate the page. I also would like to include the freeform idea that QuickStart had suggested. I think a smoother and quicker loading time would be nice. Maybe I will move the Javascript CDN's to the bottom of the page for better loading. I would also like to create my own theme as opposed to using a WEB3 basic background. This will ensure I am using the same brand across the website, one that can't be copywrite stricken* I will also add the ability for Spanish translation and hispanic resources. 

When complete, users - Social workers, and those that need resources should be able to navigate the website easily with legible information obtained on the website. This will foster a better community locally around my city.
